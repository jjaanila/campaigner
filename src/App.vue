      <part-title name="Background" />
      <chapter-title name="Prologue" />
      This campaign takes your party to Pohjola, a barren northern region based on Finnish mythology and folk lore. The
      campaign plays on DnD 5th Edition rules, and it introduces some new enemies, spells and items. The main
      inspiration for this work comes from the Finnish national epic Kalevala, composed by Elias Lönnrot, and Martti
      Haavio's studies of Finnish mythology. The story lines are partly or completely fictional and do not depict the
      original stories of Finnish folk lore. Some of the ideas have been loaned from the old stories, poems and songs
      philologists have recorded from singers and sages of the past. My intent was to paint a picture of this long gone
      world while stretching its stories and contexts a bit, just to make things more interesting. I'm not an expert of
      Finnish mythology, but just an engineer who recently started DnD and enjoyed it so much that decided to write his
      own story. This document contains real charms and spell poems that have been passed on through generations. Use
      them with great care and caution. Please also note that some of the symbols in this story are used by Finnish
      neo-nazis and other hate groups as "their" symbols. I don't want anything to do with these groups and I respect
      all people despite their religion, gender, color, or any other property. Hateful people also, because I believe
      they will come to their senses some day.
      <chapter-title name="Creation of the World" />
      In the beginning there were only gods. Among them, was goddess Ilmatar, the goddess of air. In her loneliness, she
      became bored and descended from the skies on to the waves of the sea. She was pregnant and in pain. The birthing
      would not proceed as expected and she was starting to become desperate. Meanwhile, a bluebill was circling the
      skies looking for a place to nest and lay her eggs. She was also in a hurry and had been looking for a suitable
      place a while. The bluebill spots the knee of Ilmatar above the sea waves and sees it as a suitable (or at least
      passable) place for a nest. The nest was built and eggs laid, 6 golden ones and one made of iron. After three days
      of hatching, also Ilmatar started to feel the bluebill. Ilmatar felt increasing heat that first was comfortable,
      but after a while it became stinging and soon her knee felt like burning. Like any creature, even a god, would do,
      she moved her knee under the sea waves to cool it off. The bluebill took off and her eggs broke down into tiny
      pieces which rolled into the sea. The small egg shell pieces did not get far. After touching the sea water they
      started to transform: the bottom halves of shells turned to clay, dirt, and stone, the building blocks of ground,
      and top halves built up the first sky. The brown parts of the shell became the day and sunlight, when white
      transformed into night and the moon. The night also received its stars of colored crumbs, and the blackest crumbs
      turned into clouds. After nive years, Ilmatar, still pregnant, started to mold the crude first world. She placed
      continents, islands and shores, formed the sea bottom and coasts. However, all this work still did not trigger the
      birth of her child. Thirty more years did the child spend in her mother's womb. Finally, the offspring decided it
      was time go and step into the world. So it did, but little did it expect the cold sea that was her mother's new
      home. The child of goddess fell into the raging sea and spent eight years in the waves until they threw him on a
      deserted cape. There he rose and finally looked at the world in peace. So was born the world, and Väinämöinen, the
      eternal sage.

      <chapter-title name="Pohjola" />
      Pohjola ("northern place") is a large island far north and is home to the mistress of Pohjola and a powerful witch
      Louhi, her beautiful daughter and their people. In the beginning, Pohjola was very barren, gray and lifeless
      place. However, a people was able to survive there with the help of their leader's magical powers. If the land was
      gray, lifeless and gloomy, Louhi's daughter was quite the opposite. The word of her great beauty travelled also to
      the ears of Väinämöinen, who decided to travel to the north after her hand. When crossing the sea, Väinämöinen is
      attacked by his young brother Joukahainen who envies his singing abilities and great wisdom. Joukahainen shoots
      Väinämöinen's horse with a bow and Väinämöinen falls into the sea (apparently it really was a horse, not an
      over-sized sea horse). Väinämöinen drifts to the beaches of Pohjola and manages to find Louhi's daughter, who
      however, has no interest for the gray old man. Väinämöinen has trouble getting back to south without his horse but
      Louhi promises to take care of it if Väinämöinen creates a Sampo for her. A magical artifact that produces endless
      amounts of grain, salt and gold just by rotating a lever. Sampo is often described as sort of a mill. For the sake
      of simplicity, that's what it will be in this document. Väinämöinen, in all his wisdom, realized that he is not
      able to create this artifact. He needs the help of his brother Ilmarinen, the forger of the sky dome, the eternal
      smith. He sings a spell and tricks Ilmarinen to climb on top of a spruce. Another spell produces a terrible wind
      that flies Ilmarinen all the way to Pohjola. Ilmarinen is not happy about this little trick but when Louhi offers
      her daughter's hand for him, he promises to try creating Sampo. After great effort and multiple tries he is able
      to create Sampo, a golden mill with lid of many colors, and three nozzles. One for each produced good. Louhi is
      pleased that she will finally be able to provide plentiful life for her people and locks the device into a
      mountain and secures it with nine locks. Ilmarinen requests the daughter's hand but the proud daughter is not
      pleased with Ilmarinen either. Both men return home without brides. Later Väinämöinen realizes that Pohjola has
      now everything they need for living and part of the richnesses should be spread across the world. So, with
      Ilmarinen and a young man called Lemminkäinen, they sail to Pohjola to demand part of the profits. Louhi is
      enraged by the demand and threatens the party but Väinämöinen plays his harp made of giant pike's jaw bone and
      sings a powerful spell that puts all people of Pohjola to sleep. They are able to set sail back towards south with
      the wondrous Sampo. Lemminkäinen persaudes Väinämöinen to sing for their great achievement but they are
      celebrating too soon. A common crane hears the singing and shrieks loudly which wakes the people of Pohjola. They
      start the chase with a warship. Pohjola's warship reaches the escapees but Väinämöinen is not giving up. He sings
      another spell and plucks his harp. A shoal appears to the front of the chasers' ship and the ship starts to sink.
      However, Louhi knows spells too and transforms into a giant eagle, takes few of her men on her back and continues
      the chase. A fight ensues during which Sampo accidentally falls into the sea and breaks into pieces. It is common
      knowledge that the pieces of Sampo spread with sea currents and fertilized lands, accelerated growth of
      vegetation, and made living easier in many ways also in Pohjola.

      <section-title name="In Dungeons & Dragons context" />

      I would say Pohjola is a demiplane created by Louhi. Väinämöinen also created his own called Kaleva, but it is not
      part of this adventure (yet). A large seas surrounds both and a portal connects the seas far out on the open sea
      where one can see no land.

      <section-title name="More history" />
      As told, destruction of Sampo changed Pohjola tremendously. Instead of rocky barren fields, there are now green
      plains in the heart of the land, marshes in the east and bare rocky shores in the west. Rivers cross the island
      from south to north west and along it Kalevans have built large cities, forts and smaller settlements. During the
      winter, the snowy areas of north spread south but the southern most point of the island tends to stay warmer.
      People started to inhabit Kaleva and Pohjola with increasing pace. Pohjola started to thrive as well and its
      people spread around the island. However, Kaleva people had a head start and soon their island started to feel
      inadequately small. Kalevans invaded Pohjola and drove metsäläiset, the aboriginals of Pohjola, to north, away
      from fertile lands to live on mining and hunting. Kalevans farmed, hunted and thrived. They built large cities and
      settlements around the island but left the north to metsäläiset. Kalevans were content buying metals and gemstones
      from metsäläiset and selling some grain in exchange. During the centuries, many people sought wisdom from the
      elders of Pohjola and Kaleva. Witches commonly visited Louhi to answer their questions. Väinämöinen was also
      visited but he has a more important mission than seeing fortunes or helping with mortal problems. Soon after the
      invasion, he had decided to prison the god of chaos, Perkele. Perkele and its demons, kapes, were a daily source
      of havoc and misery in Pohjola, as they tried to interrupt settlers from organizing and building their new
      communities. Demon raids were common and in the end, kapes "ate the moon" by concealing it with a spell and it was
      common belief was that sun would be next target. Väinämöinen wanted to do one more favor for his people. With the
      help of his brother Ilmarinen and the gods of Pohjola, he managed to imprison Perkele under lake Iänlampi. THe
      jail was shut with magical key called Tursaansydän, that is a large amethyst cut into shape of four tangled
      arrows. THis key was split into four pieces that were hidden in Pohjola. This was done as insurance if Perkele
      would be needed once again for some yet unknown reason. A spell protects the pieces. They can open the cell only
      when joined to the original shape, but the key also can only be destroyed when it is whole.

      <captioned-figure :path="tursaansydan" caption="Rough sketch of Tursaansydän" width="20rem" />

      <section-title name="Today" />
      Kalevans have lived hundreds of years in peace and abundance. There has been enough grain, beer, game and
      resources for all their people and a hard-working people have always been able to earn their living. Only
      occasional raids of barbarians have interfered with their bliss. Hence, disturbance in the supply lines causes
      easily confusion and restlessness. Metsäläiset have resiliently inhabited the north all this time and grown in
      numbers. Now they have reached such state that their leader, Mistress Loviatar, believes that they can take back
      what belongs to them with the help of Joukahainen and Perkele. They plan to take over Pohjola, even though it
      would require releasing chaos into the demiplane and even sacrificing the sun and the moon. Most kalevans have
      forgot the stories of the old and believe that metsäläiset are the evil of this island which was banished
      successfully from their lands. Revealing that kalevans were originally invaders creates an interesting twist to
      the story when the truth is revealed to the party.

      <read-aloud>
        You see restless dreams. You run through a forest with a wold pack. Soar through the skies in a snow storm.
        Scramble through snow higher than you are. Skitter through city streets while dodging human feet. You keep on
        jumping from dream to dream, unable to wake up. Suddenly, dream ends and you open your eyes. You all are laying
        on mossy ground of a spruce forest. The sun peeks between the tree branches and the only voice you hear is the
        soft wind in the trees.

      <read-aloud>
        Näette levottomia unia. Juoksette metsän läpi susi kannoillanne. Kiidätte ilman halki lumimyrskyssä. Rämmitte
        itseänne korkeammassa lumihangessa. Kipitätte kaupungien kaduilla väistellen ihmisten jalkola. Aivan kuin
        hyppisitte unesta toiseen, ette vain saa itseänne hereille. Pian unet päättyvät kuin seinään ja avaatte
        silmänne. Makaatte vanhan kuusimetsän siimeksessä sammalmatolla. Aurinko pilkottaa puiden oksien välistä ja
        ainoa ääni minkä kuulette on tuulen vaimea humina.

      The party has woken up in Pohjola. They are few kilometers from Bluebill's Nest where they should find themselves
      soon enough, one way or another. The party is still in shackles. Pohjola has their own gods, habits and culture.
      They know nothing of other lands and the knowledge of plane travellers, like our party, has long since forgotten.
      If the party asks about their situation the common folk should think they are crazy or laugh at them. They may
      refer to fairy tales where witches from other lands arrive to Pohjola to do evil. Of course these tales were once
      true, but this hasn't happened for over hundred years. \DndArea{Bluebill's Nest (Sotkala)} Bluebill's Nest is a
      small village which lives of fishing and hunting and trading with occasional travelers. A major road and river
      bypass the village so there is usually quite a bit of traffic. However, not many are willing to live this far away
      from major cities. Hunting and fishing are not that prolific professions either so the houses are modest and
      simply built log cabins. There are 11 smaller cabins and one larger, the White Rabbit Inn. One of the other
      smaller houses has wooden stands in front with fishes drying out in the morning sun. There is an old man repairing
      fishing nets on the porch. To north starts the road to the city of Sword, which follows the south bank of Fuller
      river. To the north is the road to the Gray Keep, Halla farm and the city of Brass Buckler. To the east is
      Hallasuo, huge marshland with just few inhabitants. To the west is river Viper's Rend (Kyynsärö).
      \DndSubArea{Courtyard}
      <read-aloud>
        The dirt courtyard is in the center of the line of houses. On its edge is a well but otherwise the yard doesn't
        seem to get much use. However, now there are four \pagelink{npc:soldierOfTheSword}{guards} cleaning their boots
        and chatting. A fancy looking wagon stands next to the road and a young elf man steps around anxiously. The man
        has fine clothing, brown long hair, and a sword on his hip.
      </read-aloud>
      \paragraph{\pagelink{npc:kainoKalpa}{Kaino Kalpa}} The man is Kaino Kalpa, a bastard of half-king Untamo
      Eteläterä. He is a proud man and doesn't appreciate that people remind him of his bastardiness. He thinks of
      himself as a prince and plans to travel to the court of Eteläterä to gain influence. He has been assigned to the
      Gray Keep since teenage and now that he has reached adulthood, it is his time. He has no time for mere peasants
      and want's to get moving as soon as possible. He plans to benefit from the unstable situation of the Blade and
      raise his ranks amid political chaos. He won't share his intent except if the party allies with him in the future.
      Kaino is able to tell the party about the turmoil in Sword cities. Two families descendants of the last Sword King
      are at each other's throats after Eteläterä's heir Armas Eteläterä fell to his dead from castle tower. The court
      of Eteläterä is suspicious of Pohjanterä. He doesn't mention that the Fuller river (Veriura) which flows between
      the two cities has changed color, tastes foul and reportedly causes sickness of children and weak of health.
      Pohjanterä court rumours that Eteläterä poisoned the water as revenge and the southern half-king has a secret
      source of clean water or a way to purify it. Secretly he thinks that the death of the heir is his chance to become
      the new heir. \paragraph{\pagelink{npc:commoner}{Kala-Kosti}} An old man sitting on his porch repairing fishing
      nets. Can tell about refugees upriver that are coming from the Sword cities escaping restlessness. If asked, he
      tends to fish along the rivers because lake Iänlampi is not the best fishing spot. It actually doesn't have fish
      at all, but let's not reveal that yet. \DndSubArea{White Rabbit Inn} The inn is a small two-story log building and
      has tavern downstairs. On the left is a wooden counter and the kitchen. Next to it are stairs that take to
      upstairs where are 3 two bed rooms up for rent. There are 5 tables downstairs.
      \paragraph{\pagelink{npc:commoner}{Tuomikki}} A female dwarf with a strong attitude. Is not happy about her
      husband's tendency to disappear to drink. "That's where he always goes. Too keen on the liquid barley! The milk of
      Pekko!" The husband is gone again so she has got drunk as well. The husband, \pagelink{npc:commoner}{Rautia}, the
      village smith, has really been taken by the bandits in a camp up north. He got drinking with them and they needed
      his services to fix their equipment. Rautia and Tuomikki live in the village in their own house. Can tell about
      the wedding in Halla Farm. She requests the party to look for her lousy husband and promises to pay 20gp.
      \paragraph{\pagelink{npc:veliHopea}{Veli Hopea}} A human male with a bag full of tales. He has killed a werewolf,
      flirted with Tellervo, the daughter of Tapio, the god of forests. He also has been taught by shaman's of the north
      and has shared a meal with the half-king of the North Edge (Pohjanterän hovi). He is bragging about everything and
      is quite loud and tries actively to find new listeners. He want's to be viewed as a prosperous man, but the times
      have been rough. He was forced to flee the twin-cities of Sword because of his drunken babbles that offended one
      of the half-kings. An informant snitched and now he is wanted by the Arm, the city guard. He plans to move towards
      south, to the Gray Keep. Now he is trying to make enough money here to continue by selling made-up stories to the
      gullible. There is a price for him in the Sword cities, so the party may catch him at some point. No-one in the
      village knows about the price though. Veli has rented a room upstairs. Is interested to visit the wedding in the
      hopes of income and the party could be a good escort there. \paragraph{\pagelink{npc:commoner}{Toiva}} A shy human
      male who inherited the Inn from relatives. He hasn't married and takes care if the inn alone. He doesn't speak
      unnecessarily and is really bad at small talk. Not the ideal innkeeper, but you do with what has been given to
      you. His wife Ano is sick with a disease of the mind which turned her into unresponsive state a year ago. Toiva
      doesn't have enough time to keep the inn running, treat her wife and look after their ten year old son Ilmari who
      roams the woods freely. He is not into innkeeping but more of an explorer. They live in a separate building next
      to the inn. If asked about rumors, he doesn't mention his wife but others in the inn can tell about this "public
      secret". Toiva doesn't speak much his life and uses short sentences. Just answer quickly and shortly and aim for
      awkward silences! A DC 10 Insight check tells the party that Toiva has something to hide. Toiva saw Rautia
      drinking with the bandits and has heard stories of bandit activity in north, on the road near Ukko's fist
      (Ukonnyrkki) settlement. \paragraph{\pagelink{npc:commoner}{Ilmari}} The son of Toiva and Ano. A bright 12 year
      old boy with a curious mind and a lot of time in his hands. He spends the time exploring nearby areas. He arrives
      to the inn when the party is there the first time to tell his father that he is afraid of the rats he was told to
      get rid of in their house basement. "They are so big and hairy!" The party can take the task of getting rid of the
      rats. Ilmari can also tell the party about Körri, family's cat who has been missing for weeks. If the party gets
      rid of the rats, Toiva will pay them 10gp and provide a free room for one night. Ilmari tells that he will go see
      "the grandpa" and runs away. \DndSubArea{Toiva's house} The simple house of Toiva, Ano and Ilmari has two large
      rooms and a cellar. It is a log house with simple wooden furniture. Dried food has been stored to the first room
      and it also has a fireplace. Second room two beds, where in the larger one lies a woman, Ano. The only sign of
      consciousness are the open eyes and occasional swallowing. This disease cannot be cured. In the cellar the party
      finds huge amount of rats, i.e. 6 \pagelink{monster:swarmOfRats}{Swarms of Rats},
      and\pagelink{monster:korri}{Körri}. The rats are Körri's little "army" he has been recruiting to take over the
      village house by house. Körri hisses and the rats turn around and attack immediately. Körri has sold his soul to a
      cat demon to get the command over his little minions. You can play this out a bit with Körri's behaviour but this
      is just a weird side quest. Don't expect it to continue.
      <section-title name="Bandit Camp" />
      \DndArea{Bandit Camp} A party of 1 \pagelink{monster:banditCaptain}{Bandit Captain} 4
      \pagelink{monster:bandit}{Bandits} have camped close to the road. One of them is keeping watch nearby close to the
      road, others are maintaining their gear but have put Rautia to do the blacksmithing. Their plan is to take Rautia
      with them, but he doesn't actually mind. He is enjoying the perks of his new environment, contents of a captured
      beer delivery, and has decided to leave Bluebill's Nest to seek easier life of a drunk. He doesn't fight of fear.
      If the party kills the bandits, Rautia is miserable due to the lost opportunity. He needs something stronger than
      beer and tells that he is heading towards Ukonnyrkki settlement which is nearby. A chest in the camp contains
      50gp.
      <section-title name="Wedding" />

      \DndArea{Halla Farm} This is a large farm south of Sotkala, next to a huge marshland Hallasuo. The marshland has
      been owned by Halla family for centuries but marsh doesn't much so the land is worthless. Also the air in the
      marshes cools down significantly during the nights making the environment even harsher for plants. Not many dare
      to venture there as tales tell that people go mad and drown themselves into swamp pools. People got lost and their
      clothes were found from the marshes. It is rumored that evil creatures inhabit the area nowadays. Tapio Halla or
      other family members can tell about these tales and rumours. \begin{DndReadAloud} You arrive to a farmstead and
      see a lot of people sitting around a long table. All of them are wearing exceptionally clean and formal clothes
      and the place has been decorated with birch branches and flowers. This is a wedding of the man at the end of the
      long table, Antero Halla and his fiancee Vilja Halla. The man at the end of the table rises and the crowd goes
      silent. The man holds a tin bucket high and starts to sing: "Mehtolan metinen muori, Metän kultanen kuningas, Tule
      nyt häihin härköisiis, Pitkän villaisi pitoihin." He starts walking and others rise up and follow. Soon they form
      a line and move behind the lead singer. \end{DndReadAloud} If the party follows: \begin{DndReadAloud} The crowd
      walks silently across the road and climbs all the way to top of a nearby hill. There the leader stops at a large
      gray ash tree. The tree is lush but barely the party sees some ornaments on its branches. The man lays down the
      container. He puts his hands inside and brings up a freshly cleaned bear skull, still dripping last drops of
      blood. He sings again: "En pistä sua pihlajaan, Enkä raitaan rakenna, Vaan honkaan hyvään puuhun, johon tuuli
      käypi pohjoisesta ja etelästä ja kaikilta tuulilta." Suddenly Vilja opens her mouth and sings with the same
      melody: "Tule, poikani polonen, Tuolla on ollut suuren suon sivulla, Ei oo tulta ei tulusta, Vara saaha valkijata"
      The man walks up to the tree and ties the fresh skull on the trunk. Suddenly the party realize that the ornaments
      are older skulls. Silently the crowd turns back and starts walking back to the farm. \end{DndReadAloud} At the
      farm the crowd returns to celebration. Here the party can find the Halla family, father Tapio, mother Vilja, and
      three girls Kylli, Lempo, and Mielo. Tapio or Vilja can explain that the ritual returns the bear back to its
      mother who will send it back on earth to be hunted again. They can also tell about the marshes, about temperature
      changes, the ownership but they don't speak about the tales and rumours eagerly. They will if they are asked or if
      one of their children happens to mention about them. They have been wondering why Tapio's brother's family didn't
      arrive to the bear celebration (karhunpeijaiset). Their farm is on the south east side of the marshes. They cannot
      leave their kids right now so they request the party to investigate and promise to pay 20g.
      <section-title name="Forgotten Marshes" />
      \DndSubArea{Halla Farm -> Hallaneva Farm} To east leads a little traversed path. It goes through grassy lands and
      sparse woods. To north the party sees denser forests with no visible paths. After few kilometers they meet a
      stranger, a tough looking dwarf woman next to a wagon, which leans heavily on its side. The woman
      \pagelink{npc:commoner}{Jutikka Äyräs}, a merchant, sits against its side and examines a broken wagon wheel in her
      hands. She is seemingly tired as she doesn't notice the party at first. She explains that her wagon wheel fell off
      the path and broke with the wagon axle. She was going to Hallasuo encampment to trade fur and silver. Her
      mercenary guards left to get help back to the farm west yesterday morning but she hasn't seen them since. They
      should have arrived already. She proposes that the party helps her carry what they can to Hallasuo encampment,
      which she explains is a trader outpost on a shortcut through the marshes. From there she can get more help. She
      promises to pay 20gp each. In reality she wants to lure them into a trap, the same one she lured the Halla brother
      Jurva and his son Osmo. Luckily their mother and sick daughter stayed home. DC 15 insight check allows the party
      to sense that something fishy is going on. DC 10 intimidation check will make to reveal what she knows about the
      trap and the operation. \DndArea{Hallasuo encampment} The party can try to fix the wagon they will need
      Carpenter's Tools and a DC 18 check. If the succeed, the woman will request them to escort her with even higher
      fee. If the party helps to escort the lady, she leads them to a hidden path covered with branches and takes them
      into the forest. After some walking, a hemp web is dropped from trees high above and the party is ambushed. DC 15
      Wisdom saving throw allows them to notice the web. DC 10 Acrobatics saving throw to get out of the way. Characters
      tangled in the web become Restrained and need DC 10 Athletics check if they want to start moving.
      \begin{DndComment}{Restrained} \item A restrained creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus

      \pagelink{monster:kobold}{Kobolds} emerge from the forest and try to swarm the party. The dwarf woman curses of
      the inefficacy and escapes through the forest into the marshes. If the party searches, they find a trail to a
      kobold camp outpost. From the outpost another path leads to the marshes and soon to the camp which is currently
      empty but contains a chest with 10g in a lean to shelter covered with moss. The chest has a trap that strikes out
      sharp stick and requires a DC 10 Perception check to notice if searching for traps. Otherwise a DC 15 Acrobatics
      check to dodge the trap. The trap affects only the person opening the chest with 1d6+2 damage. When the chest is
      opened and the trap goes off two Kobolds attack. If the trap is disarmed or doesn't hit, the kobolds run and can
      be pursued. The chest contains five letters. The earliest dated letter describes the plot that the party just
      became a victim of and orders to deliver the captured "searchers" to the main camp. Later letters order to keep
      "the operation" ongoing and keep on delivering "searchers". One of the letters has a broken black seal with some
      kind of wings on it. It is hard to see properly. The dates of letters span for a period of half a year. The dates
      just aren't the same as what the party has experienced before. According to them, it is now year 470. At their own
      plane, the year is 1356. \begin{DndComment}{What kobolds and Jutikka know?} DC 15 Intimidation check is enough
      that either tells about the search operation in the marshes. A secret group has hired kobolds to search for some
      kind structure or artifact at the marshes. They don't really know what they a searching but they were instructed
      "you will know when you find it". To hasten the search they have captured people to work for them. Jurva and Osmo
      Halla have been taken to the labor camp in the middle of the marsh. \end{DndComment} \DndArea{Hallasuo Base Camp}
      Another path leads from the camp deeper into the marsh. The further the party travels, the denser the air gets
      with the smell of rotting vegetation and vision is blocked by dense mist. If Jutikka survives, she is found stuck
      in a marsh pool and calls for help. She promises to tell what she knows about the Hallas. The party may use her to
      get into the dungeon without a fight. After walking blindly just staring at their feet, they arrive to a small
      plank bridge which crosses a ditch full of water and soon after the terrain turns drier. The mist is not as severe
      here. Soon they see fires ahead and hear talking in Draconic. It is a camp of three large tents which surround a
      low dark structure. Group of 8 kobolds are cooking and resting by the fire and can be surprised. They will attack
      if they notice the party. Looting the kobolds yields 20gp. The structure in the middle of the camp is a rectangle
      shaped platform made of stone blocks. On the fire side, there are stairs leading down underground. It is possible
      to sneak in past the kobolds with a DC 15 stealth check. \DndArea{Monastery of Ukko} \DndSubArea{Entry Hall} The
      party descends down torch lit stairs into a hall with two lines of pillars. In the end of the hall is a wall size
      symbol of Ukko called Ukonvasara (Hammer of Ukko) made of iron and covered in rust. The place is clearly hundreds
      of years old. On the sides are five doorways on each side. Two first on the right have collapsed and cannot be
      accessed. Next two have closed doors but the last one is open. On the left first two have been barred shut with
      heavy latches. If the party makes noise, they can hear something banging against the first door. Behind is a
      \pageLink{monster:rustMonster}{Rust Monster} that attacks if the door is opened. If the second door is opened, a
      Swarm of Insects attacks. Third and fourth doors are sealed with a magical seal can be opened with Knock. Inside
      is a unfortunate kobold corpse that got trapped in when the monastery was discovered. Behind the last door is a
      badly burned corpse and the door has also mostly burned away. The party should finally continue through the last
      door on the right. \begin{figure}[h!] \caption{Ukonvasara} \includegraphics[scale=1]{img/ukonvasara.png}
      \end{figure} Two \pagelink{npc:metsalainenSoldier}{Metsäläinen Soldiers} guard the hall in the middle of it and
      are commanded to let none pass unless accompanied with a high ranking leader. The soldiers are clad in simple
      leather cloths. Kobolds are not allowed down in the monastery (except for scouting dangerous areas). The soldiers
      will attack and one tries to run to warn others in the bed chamber. If the soldiers are examined closely the party
      finds a small bird foot sown to their shirts, right above heart. \DndSubArea{Bed Chamber} This chamber is used by
      the cult to rest. There are three soldiers sleeping on the beds and one is tending to his gear with his back
      turned towards the door. \DndSubArea{Library} An old library with plenty of old books and scrolls written with old
      runes. Two \pagelink{npc:metsalainenCleric}{clerics} are studying the documents intently. There is a secret door
      that leads to a room with a chest. DC 10 Perception check finds a lever behind a bookshelf that opens the secret
      door, but if the roll is below 15 PC misses the more worn lever that also disables the arrow trap inside. Two
      arrows fly out of the room and PC has to succeed DC 10 Acrobatics check to avoid them. Inside the chest is one
      Potion of Healing, Scroll of Unseen Servant, and a garnet. \DndSubArea{Kitchen} A soldier is preparing food next
      to a large pot. A large \pagelink{monster:mastiff}{Mastiff} rests on the floor drooling after a meal. When the
      door is opened it starts barking which alerts the cook and the \pagelink{npc:metsalainenCleric}{cleric} in the
      corridor north-east of kitchen. The cleric will attack the party from behind. \DndSubArea{Study} A large room once
      full of desks and some bookshelves. This room was used to study large amount of information that was gathered
      studying Ukko's prophecies. Now the desks have been replaced with sturdier tables but the purpose of the room
      still stands. There are 3 \pagelink{npc:metsalainenCleric}{clerics} reading through books and making notes. 4
      human \pagelink{npc:commoner}{slaves} are organizing the place and helping the clerics. One soldier stands in
      watch and makes sure the slaves are doing their job. The clerics will attack when they notice the party. Slaves
      may help the party if needed. From the study starts a long corridor full of wall inscriptions of past events and
      stories. Two more slaves are carefully cleaning the walls of dirt to reveal the paintings. Two soldiers stand
      behind them. There are various paintings painted with different styles. Detailed images of a white swan in a black
      river and a lady in the middle of a sea with a bird on her leg, but also crude depictions of bears, squirrels and
      other animals. \DndSubArea{Rain Hall} Rain Hall is a high hall with 6 pillars in two rows. The ceiling is sphere
      shaped and 60ft tall. In the middle of the ceiling is a stalactite like smooth pole which descends down for 20
      feet. The ceiling is full of small holes that shine faint light and drizzle down water. Down on the floor the
      water drops create a rain like effect. At the end of the hall is a large round pool with live vegetation around
      it, some stunted shrubs and grass that has only faintly green color. Otherwise the hall floor has only rubble
      where the ceiling has lost its strength during the centuries. With closer inspection and added lighting it can be
      seen that the paintings cover the walls of the hall. The ceiling is depiction of the night sky but the walls are
      still so dirty that the images cannot be inspected. At the pool sits metsäläinen \pagelink{npc:ahtoPiki}{Ahto
      Piki} examining the vegetation. Two slaves are cleaning the pillars at the same end of the hall. One of them is
      Osmo Halla, Tapio Halla's nephew and Jurva Halla's son. The slaves may warn the Cult Fanatic or help the party in
      the fight or not, I let you decide. Ahto Piki has 100gp, and an order letter from their leader which has the same
      black seal as seen in previous letters. Now it can be seen that the bird in question is an eagle.
      \begin{DndReadAloud} The letter says: Finally some true progress! Patience was again key to success just as we
      anticipated. Finding the monastery may give us the answers we need but the small amount of documents is indeed
      disheartening. It seems the ancestors were clever enough to try taking their secrets into their graves. Keep on
      looking, they must have missed something. May the trees shade your path. \end{DndReadAloud} After the fight, Osmo
      Halla reveals that his father was commanded to the marshes to show the abductors some other possibly interesting
      location in exchange for his son's freedom. He left his son behind because the journey is dangerous. Osmo has been
      cleaning the paintings for two days and hasn't eavesdropped anything significant. Osmo also knows the location his
      father spoke of. It is another structure few kilometers to north and almost completely submerged under water.
      \clearpage \begin{figure}[h!] \caption{Monastery of Ukko} \includegraphics[scale=0.20]{img/ukko_monastery.png}
      \end{figure} \clearpage \DndArea{Hallasuo Cache} The party should follow Osmo to Hallasuo Cache, which is a secret
      storage that Ukko worshippers left behind. There they will find 15 kobolds carrying supplies and tools, Jurva
      Halla and a tall elder bearded human male with black robes and a bird claw on his shirt. He is
      \pagelink{npc:joukahainen}{Joukahainen} but let's keep that as a secret for now. The area around the structure is
      almost dry in a rippling 90ft circle of magic. The man seems to be preparing for something and kobolds stand
      around him anxiously waiting. The man is placing various objects on the ground but the party can't see them well.
      Jurva Halla stays still a numb look on his face, with eyes like glass. The party most likely waits to see what
      happens. After a few minutes the man starts to speak: \begin{DndReadAloud} Säkei'en säilö, sammio salain
      saarretun, salas saranoi narauta, laverra lukkoi lorun, vaivoin valokses vierrä, kives koverra, Perkeleen piirun
      painomana. \end{DndReadAloud} The party hears a faint rumble which starts to grow. First thin cracks form on the
      structure's surface and then pieces of stone blocks start to fall off to ground. At times block pieces jump back
      on their places forced by a counter-acting spell, but the man's power seems to be too much. The structure is near
      collapsing when one of its walls breaks outwards with great force and two kobolds get crushed to death by flying
      stone blocks. A \pagelink{monster:golemGuardian}{Golem Guardian} shrieks and steps out attacking nearby kobolds
      crushing two with just one swing. The man stops channeling the spell surprised. Simultaneously Jurmo Halla seems
      to gain his wits and looks around confused and in increasing horror. The golem continues to ravage the kobolds
      while the man sneaks inside the structure. Soon he comes out with a brown sack in his hand, takes a look at the
      party one last time and vanishes into air. The main thing here is to describe Stone Golem's immense power clearly.
      The party should ideally get Jurmo, Osmo and themselves to safety because the golem will likely be too much for
      the party. Jurmo and/or Osmo may die here, your call. After the event, Jurmo or Osmo cannot tell much about the
      abductors other than they were searching for some ancient information. Osmo finally remembers that one of the
      cultists called them as Woodeners (Metsäläiset). They know the marshes well so that is why they knew the location
      of the cache, although they had no idea of its purpose. They didn't know about the monastery as it was completely
      submerged. They propose that they continue to their farm in the south-east corner of Hallasuo to rest.
      \DndArea{Hallaneva Farm} Here are Jurmo Halla's wife Mielitty and sick daughter Liekko. They will tell that Jurmo
      and Osmo left to the wedding but haven't returned yet. If the party arrives with the men, the wife is shocked of
      their condition and Jurmo will explain the situation. The daughter lies sick in bed with Horkka disease, commonly
      believed to be caused by similarly named Demon. Horkka causes high fever and convulsions and can be deadly for
      children and elder. If the party cures the child's disease, Jurmo happily requests to pray for Tellervo, the
      daughter of god Tapio, to bless the party. He leads them through a dense patch of forest to a Tapio's table, which
      is a short juniper tree which has grown horizontally to a table like form. He speaks a spell: \begin{DndReadAloud}
      Honkien haltija, korpikantoin kaihtija, Tyttäres Tellervoinen, impi iän ikuinen, taivu ainoinen Tapio, päästä
      neito pöytähän, hopiat luovun halustani, pöydän korean kannelle. \end{DndReadAloud} During the last verse, he
      carves few slices of silver onto the table. He leaves and beckons the party to follow. Back at the farm he thanks
      the party again and wishes them Tapio's and Tellervo's guidance. He also requests the party to take his
      congratulations to Halla farm and to explain the situation. The party does not feel any different. DC 10 religion
      check can be done to remember mention of an ancient foreign god of forest, Tapio. The party has now received
      Tellervo's blessing and they will find an item leaning against a tree during their trip back to Halla Farm and
      20pp.

      \DndArea{The Gray Bridge} The Gray Bridge crosses across the ferocious current of Viper's Rend east of
      \DndAreaRef{Gray keep} and west of \DndAreaRef{Halla Farm}. It is an important supply route providing seafood and
      minerals to the settlements of Pohjola. At the start of this adventure, metsäläiset have destroyed the bridge to
      harass kalevans. The bridge will be repaired during first few days. Crossing the river is very hard due to its
      strong current. A group of \pagelink{npc:soldierOfTheSword}{Soldiers of the Sword} guards the bridge. Another
      group of \pagelink{npc:commoner}{Commoners} is fixing the bridge while pressured by the soldiers. Soldiers should
      question the party and try to sort out what is the meaning of their trip. A decent bribe might help to get the
      party out of this situation. \DndArea{The Gray Keep} A great keep on the shore of western Pohjola. It is built on
      barren rocky land that continues all the way to the border of the north along the sea. This area has very little
      life but the sea offers plenty of fish, crabs, and mussels. Terrain is rocky and barren and deep crevasses divide
      the shore to long platforms that reach to the sea. The keep was built by metsäläiset but after they were banished,
      kalevan fishermen made it their home. Catch was great so little by little they kept on spreading and extending
      their fortress. The keep is crudely built stony building but sometimes receives prestigious residents, although
      often royally disliked characters. \pagelink{npc:kainoKalpa}{Kaino Kalpa} spent five years there managing the keep
      but leaving most of the accounting and decision making to his advisors. Sometimes he preferred to make arbitrary
      decisions about things he knew nothing about, just to feel himself important and needed. He has now left the keep
      to the relief of locals.
      <section-title name="Missing Boats" />
      \paragraph{\pagelink{npc:commoner}{Ikitiera}} A young elf male Ikitera now administrates the economics of the
      keep. He keeps track of fishing quotas and sends the seafood deliveries towards the inner land. He is a meticulous
      man who loves numbers, tables, and accounting in general. He just doesn't understand why his fishermen keep going
      missing. Five boats have disappeared during four weeks and the scouts haven't found a sign of the boats. They have
      mostly searched further away from the shore so he suggests that the party should stay closer to the shoreline,
      especially if they don't have sailing experience. He also recommends talking to
      \pagelink{npc:grayKeepMilitia}{Commander Pulkkinen} as he is investigating another issue. The boats have been sunk
      by a \pagelink{monster:saltwaterScrag}{Saltwater Scrag}. It has anchored some boats to the ocean floor and eaten
      the fishermen and their catch. The party has to take a boat to lure the scrag out of the sea. Killing the scrag
      may reveal its nest on the sea floor that contains a 2 carat diamond and the Cap of Water Breathing. Ikitiera
      offers a reward of 10 50gp gemstones. \DndItemHeader{Cap of Water Breathing (Meren Myssy)}{Wondrous item,
      uncommon} While wearing this cap underwater, you can speak its command word as an action to create a bubble of air
      around your head. It allows you to breathe normally underwater. This bubble stays with you until you speak the
      command word again, the cap is removed, or you are no longer underwater.
      <section-title name="Fishy Business" />
      \paragraph{\pagelink{npc:grayKeepMilitia}{Commander Pulkkinen}} A military officer turned ex-fisherman Pulkkinen
      is a burly dwarf male with rugged worker hands and a face oldened by sea weather. He is not the most traditional
      commander but so isn't Gray Keep militia either. All have some kind of background in fishing so they understand
      Pulkkinen's peculiar commands, like "Sharpen your hooks!" to do equipment maintenance. He should also use all
      kinds of fishing expressions in his speech: "Have a reely good day.", "Seems a bit fishy to me.", "You've been
      schooled.". Pulkkinen tells the party that someone has been stealing their catch from "the tank". He explains that
      the tank is a large artificial pond they have created to keep the fish alive and fresh until they are sold to
      merchants. He suggests that the party investigates the tank. The issue was noticed yesterday when they conducted
      the first inspection of the tank in a long time. Earlier Kaino Kalpa had taken the solid responsibility of it
      without really doing his job. Pulkkinen doesn't trust Kaino and always suspected that there was something fishy
      about him. He spent most of his time dreaming about becoming the half-king. Kaino allowed metsäläiset to install
      the portal to the bottom for a promise that the would become the half-king one day. \DndSubArea{The Tank} A half
      ball shaped pond carved into the rocky shore. It is covered with a leathery cover that keeps the birds and other
      animals away. There are lids that can be opened to look inside. Hand nets with long shafts lie next to the lids. A
      member of \pagelink{npc:grayKeepMilitia}{Gray Keep Militia} circles around the pond. The guard claims they have
      seen nothing unusual except the amount of fish has been reducing. On the bottom of the tank is a 2ft wide portal
      that leads to a cave river in a cave at the north end of the shoreline. The fish are able to escape through it. If
      the party dives and goes through the portal they find themselves in an underground river and start to drift with
      the current. Only DC 18 athletics check allows a party member to swim back to the portal. The river takes them
      through a dark tunnel into an underground lake. Closer to the bank, on the other side of the lake, party sees a
      \pagelink{monster:northernGiant}{Northern Giant} standing waist deep in water. It swings a large net, catching
      fish and emptying the catch into a cart. When the cart is full, the giant pushes it out of the cave to the next
      chamber. It has to crawl on its knees to fit through the exit tunnel. \DndSubArea{Salting Chamber} From the
      underground lake a tunnel leads to a large chamber with six \pagelink{npc:commoner}{metsäläinens} cleaning and
      salting fish. Fish are finally packed to wagons that are dragged away. In addition, there is a man in wooden hand
      carved armour that is supervising the workers called \pagelink{npc:montaja}{Montaja}. He is sitting on a stool
      working on another piece of wood with puukko (a simple knife). He has a letter sealed with a black bird seal that
      says: \begin{DndReadAloud} You are doing well but that is not enough. Get rid of the abomination, it is slowing us
      down right now. We need more provisions to keep the people going. Exploration at the marshes has been fruitful and
      I believe we will soon find the second fragment. May the forest guard your dreams. \end{DndReadAloud}
      \DndSubArea{Fish Thieves' Crevasse} One of the rock crevasses on the west Pohjola shoreline. At the far back edge
      of the crevasse is a cave and 3 \pagelink{npc:metsalainenSoldier}{Metsäläinen Soldiers} guarding the entrance and
      two fish wagons outside of it. There are also four glass jars full of fish oil on the ground. Few times a day a
      \pagelink{npc:commoner}{courier} comes and takes one wagon away with the help of two horses.

      <chapter-title name="Ukko's Fingers" />
      <section-title name="The Mad Chief" />
      <area-title name="Ukko's Fist (Ukonnyrkki) settlement" />
      Ukko's Fist is a settlement north of Bluebill's Nest. A small castle and few tens of log houses are surrounded by
      a crude wooden wall. Fields surround the keep and most of the citizens have housing in the safety of settlement
      walls. Majority of the citizens are farmers but few crafts, like weaving and woodcrafting are also practiced.
      Farming of barley is however the main source of income. Ukko's Fist is led by \pagelink{npc:chiefIkaheimo}{Chief
      Ikäheimo}, who has ruled the settlement well in the past. During the last months his actions have seemed
      unpredictable. He has increased the amount of combat training of citizens significantly so they have very little
      time after farming and training duties. He also started selling majority of their produced barley to a forestry
      group and rumours tell that the price was lower than what the Sword cities were paying. He is being mind
      controlled by Joukahainen with a gem on his golden ring which he fiddles with when he is being forced to a
      decision. He received the ring as an anonymous gift. \DndSubArea{Keep} The keep in the center of the settlement is
      the home of Chief Ikäheimo and his wife \pagelink{npc:commoner}{Tarjanne}. The keep has two floors above the
      ground and a dungeon floor for prisoners. On the ground floor there are the main hall, kitchen, arms storage and
      two smaller bedrooms for guests or house staff. On the top floor, there are the main bed room, a reading room and
      two more bed rooms for house staff. In the dungeon are few cells with just one prisoner witch Autere.
      \paragraph{\pagelink{npc:autere}{Witch Autere}} She is an old black haired elf lady who lived in Ukko's Fist. She
      was publicly accepted healer whose "experiments" with old magics got the blind eye of the village. However, a half
      a year ago she was thrown into jail for "crossing the line" but the reason wasn't publicly announced. In her
      words, she didn't do anything, which is true. Chief Ikäheimo threw her into jail because she would have noticed
      the mind controlling ring. She knows about old magic and is able to tell the party about their situation after
      they help free her. She has had enough of helping other people for nothing. After she is freed, she will tell that
      they have used an old spell that transferred the party to another plane. Usually there would have been another
      person that ends the spell in their own plane. There might be another way but she doesn't know it. The royal
      archives in the Sword cities could contain the answer. If the party requests her to inspect Chief Ikäheimo for a
      disease one last time, she complies. They just have to figure out how to do that with the wife. If they succeed,
      Autere realizes the ring's significance and tells the party to destroy it. After all of this, Autere leaves the
      town. For curing the chief, chief gives them a 1 carat Diamond as a reward. \paragraph{Chief Ikäheimo} A strong
      middle-aged dwarf male who is the son of late smith Ikäheimo. Rose to chiefdom through his skill of inspiring and
      natural charm by a public vote. Has become overconfident over the years and easily irritable after he received the
      ring. The ring works with a bit of delay, so he may start answering truthfully, but then switch to a lie. After
      this he fiddles his ring. Has a task for the party which requires them to fetch a travelling seer and throw him
      into his dungeon. He claims that the seer is actually a known necromancer who is suspected of Armas Eteläterä's
      murder. Truly, he has just been working as a fortuneteller and may be able to identify the ring. He can be found
      in the local inn. The reward will be 10gp each and his trust. The party is able to notice his fiddling with a DC
      18 Perception check. When they face more an more lies, the check should become easier. The check can be tried
      again each time they meet him. \paragraph{\pagelink{npc:commoner}{Tarjanne}} Wife of Chief Ikäheimo. Calm and
      rational dwarf lady who has been worried about her husband because he hasn't been the same for a while. She
      suspects sickness and asks the party to heal her husband. She would have asked Autere but she is in the dungeon.
      \paragraph{\pagelink{npc:soldierOfTheSword}{Dog (Koira)}} The dungeon guard Dog is a thoughtful dwarf male. Not
      very strong, so he isn't the best soldier but guarding cells doesn't usually require much physically and he likes
      the solidarity. He has been thinking about why the witch has been jailed because she seemed like a good person.
      She even healed his syphilis (huovintauti). Dog can be assured of his theory by finding some information to back
      it up and with DC 10 persuasion check. They can also lie about the information. They just need the credibility for
      that, so bringing the seer to the dungeon works fine. If successful, he will let the party to fake an intrusion
      somehow. Another way to enter the dungeon is through a chimney that goes through the whole keep. On upper floors,
      it can be accessed through kitchen or the main bed room. Finding the vent requires a DC 15 Perception check in one
      of the rooms when searching for a way into the dungeon. \DndSubArea{Heaven's Inn (Taivain Majatalo)} A small inn
      next to the settlement entrance. The seer has a room upstairs. There are five men sharing a table downstairs. The
      innkeeper is not around. When the party goes upstairs there are four doors of which one is open. When they
      approach any of the doors, they hear a voice from the open room: "Come in.".
      \paragraph{\pagelink{npc:kaukovalta}{Seer Kaukovalta}} Seer Kaukovalta is an old male human with bald head and a
      long fake beard. It can be noticed with DC 10 perception check. The beard is just for the looks, it, in his words,
      is more convincing in seer work than his completely bald face. He has been hairless since born. He sits on his bed
      and demands to know why they have come to get him, although calmly. He is an actual seer, but can't see very far
      into the future. His visions are usually hard to interpret. When the party talks with him, the five men from
      downstairs walk behind them calmly with hands on their wooden clubs. Seer hired the men to cover for him and told
      the innkeeper to hide. The party can fight the \pagelink{monster:thug}{men} and capture the seer or convince him
      to join a plot to infiltrate the dungeon. Seer will be reluctant to join the plot. He sees a reward in his future
      but he suspects that he could get it also from his regular customers. After the encounter, the innkeeper raises
      his head above the counter. If asked about rumours, he tells that \pagelink{npc:commoner}{Leino} has been missing
      for days after he went bear hunting. His dog Myy ran back one day ago and arrived to the inn. The dog is behind
      the inn. The dog can be captured and leashed with DC 10 animal handling check. If the dog escapes they can try to
      run after it with a DC 10 athletics check. The dog returns to the inn after a while and then the party may try
      again. A piece of meat makes the check succeed every time.
      <section-title name="Down Below" />
      The dog can take them into the woods where they find a bloody site. Closer inspection shows dragging marks and
      blood stains on the foliage. They continue into a hole under a trunk of a fallen tree. They can crawl after him
      into a dark tunnel that fits only one man at a time. The tunnel takes them into a low room where only small
      characters can stand straight. Others suffer -1 for all combat rolls (not damage) due to awkward positions during
      their time there. The place is completely dark.
      <area-title name="Underdark (Maanalanen)" />
      These tunnels need to be describe as vast and completely dark but only some of them are made explorable in this
      adventure. You should let the Deep Gnomes guide the party e.g. to \DndSubAreaRef{Dark Chamber} and describe how
      deep you are going. Don't take the map too literally. \clearpage \begin{figure}[h!] \caption{Underdark}
      \includegraphics[scale=0.20]{img/underdark.png} \end{figure} \clearpage \DndSubArea{Entrance} A low room with a
      12ft pit on the other side. Narrow ledges go around it and can be used to go around the pit with DC 10 dexterity
      for larger than small creatures. If the party causes noise, \pagelink{monster:deepGnome}{Deep Gnomes} from
      \DndSubAreaRef{Guard Chamber} will come investigate. \DndSubArea{River Chamber} An underground river goes through
      this room and can take the party next to \DndSubAreaRef{Living Chamber}. \DndSubArea{Guard Chamber} A room Deep
      Gnomes use as a guarding spot ensuring no-one unexpected wanders into their tunnels. Has two guarding Deep Gnomes.
      \DndSubArea{Animal Chamber} Two Deep Gnomes are taking care of their pet, a \pagelink{monster:rustMonster}{Rust
      Monster} called Haisu. They use it to find iron, but sometimes it tends to escape to the outside world. It has
      confronted Leino in the wild and dragged him into the tunnels as prey. Deep Gnomes were not happy about it and
      have been trying to nurse Leino back to health. Two Deep Gnomes and Haisu are in this chamber. \DndSubArea{Living
      Chamber} Here Deep Gnomes spend their time crafting and maintaining tools. Three Deep Gnomes stay there.
      \DndSubArea{Resting Chamber} Five Deep Gnomes are examining Leino and trying to help him medically. One of the
      Deep Gnomes is their healer and expects Leino to survive. He can give the party a quest to retrieve the remains of
      their fellow Deep Gnomes that dug too deep and are likely killed by the beasts of the depths in
      \DndSubAreaRef{Dark Chamber}. He promises 100gp and a fine obsidian Dagger they found from the depths. The dagger
      has old runes on it that spell Light Carver (Valonvuolija). Old runes can be read only by few in Pohjola.
      \DndItemHeader{Light Carver (Valonvuolija)}{Wondrous item, rare} Dagger +2. A light obsidian dagger that makes one
      blind in daylight but gives perfect vision in the dark. Basically, it flips the light and dark sights, so a
      wielder with dark sight can see in light.
      <sub-area-title name="Dark Chamber" />
      A chamber that was revealed by Deep Gnome miners. When they entered it, four Darkmantles attacked and killed them.
      Their remains are still there. The hole they made is on the top of the chamber near the ceiling. The ceiling is
      weirdly black and cannot be brighten with light sources. Darkmantles are keeping it dark and waiting an attack
      opportunity.
      <sub-area-title name="Treasury" />
      contains the treasures of Deep Gnomes. In addition to Light Carver and 100gp, there are also two 1 carat diamonds,
      five malachites and lots of iron.
      <section-title name="To the Sword" />
      <area-title name="Forestry Camp" />
      A base camp for metsäläinen loggers to camp in. They are logging and selling the wood to provide income for
      Metsäläiset organization. They have spread their activities from north towards south are almost at the Fuller
      river. Logging supports their cause because they can also search for ancient sites for the information they are
      missing. They have set their camp in an ancient hill-fort of Meadowruin (Ahonraunio) long abandoned. The loggers
      were the ones who destroyed the bridge with a log "bulldozer", a massive amount of logs tied together and powered
      by the river current. The camp has one long log house which has sleeping space for loggers. It has two rooms, a
      small kitchen in the end and a large room full of bunks. A small hole in the wall allows the loggers to get their
      rations from the kitchen. One human male is handling the cooking by stirring a large pot of stew. There may be
      plenty of logger Commoners around depending the time of day. There is also another log house for the camp officer.
      Two guards stand outside and the officer is inside keeping accounts and calculating paychecks. He has a bird's
      feet on his shirt. The officer, \pagelink{npc:commoner}{Kauko}, is quite unpleasantly blunt man and cannot be
      intimidated easily. He lies that they know nothing about the bridge collapse but suspects the rebels of the
      refugee camp up river of framing them. Workers may be more easily intimidated but there may be a large number of
      them, so things may turn ugly! The workers can admit that they did it but they were just commanded to do so. If
      the officer is intimated to speak, he tells that the point is to accelerate the restlessness in Pohjola. He
      receives his commands in letters carried by birds but isn't sure who is sending them.
      <area-title name="Ambushed by metsäläiset" />
      An ambush that is supposed to happen after the party has disrupted metsäläiset for the first time, or the second
      time, your call. Metsäläiset want to know who they are dealing with so they try to interrogate at least one member
      of the party. A \pagelink{monster:northernDruid}{Northern Druid} and 3 \pagelink{monster:deathDog}{Death Dogs} are
      hiding next to the road. When the party arrives the Druid starts to speak and the dogs start to circle around the
      party. He requests to know who the party members are and asks why they interfered with the operation at the
      marshes. A fight may ensue. \DndArea{Refugee Camp} Refugees of the Sword cities have built a camp to the south
      side of Fuller river. They have their own village of shacks and some have even built small log cabins. More
      refugees are coming in constantly and there is shortage of food. There is also a problem with northern barbarians
      regularly attacking the camp. The refugees can tell about the political turmoil and the spoilt river water. They
      all have their own beliefs of the causes behind the issues. They have heard about the collapsed bridge and are
      worried about their supply delivery. Most of the people around seem starved and desperate. Refugee leader tells
      that the barbarians have a safe place up north in an old ruin. They must have food stored there since they have
      been robbing a lot lately. Refugee camp leader \pagelink{npc:soldierOfTheSword}{Kyösti} try to assure the party
      that they had nothing to do with the bridge collapse. He requests the party to take care of the barbarians. They
      have nothing to offer as reward in addition to a warm meal but they suspect that the ancient barbarian stronghold
      may hold valuables treasures. There are also rumours of a ghost in the camp. A small ghost of a
      \pagelink{monster:myling}{child} has reportedly appeared two times at night. It cries and tries to attack people.
      Kyösti thinks people are hallucinating because of hunger. If the party kills the ghost, it will vanish and
      reappear the next night. A desperate refugee woman killed her newborn child, because she wasn't able to nourish
      him, and buried him under their shack due to shame. The child's soul has been trapped into this plane and can be
      freed only with proper burial, i.e. a Myling (Ihtiriekko). The woman committed suicide afterwards which caused a
      great shock in the camp. She had told others that she sent the child away with the father. In truth, the father
      hasn't been involved in a long time and has left the camp. After the party resolves the case, Kyösti writes them a
      letter to be delivered to the court of Eteläterä. A reward waits for the party there. The letter is sealed with a
      purple seal of a horizontal sword with the top half removed. If read, It contains also intelligence information of
      the area. This isn't just a refugee camp after all but an intelligence unit has been hidden here. The letter
      writes that they suspect the loggers of sabotage at the bridge. Kyösti proposes that the party takes care of the
      barbarians before leaving to the Sword. If the party does so, Kyösti confesses his part in Eteläterä's
      intelligence operation and asks if the party found anything about metsäläiset. He includes the information to the
      letter and hands it over to the party.
      <section-title name="Temple of Päivätär" />
      <area-title name="Holy of The Valley (Alangon Pyhä)" />
      This is an ancient temple that is used by northern barbarians as a shelter. The temple is located in the middle of
      a valley between two fjelds but on the ground there is only a stone platform and stairs down into the temple.
      Barbarians have set up a leather tent on top of it to hide it and cover it from the elements. Inside, they have
      ripped down all ancient symbols and replaced them with their own, crude wall paintings of animals, animal skulls
      and spruce branches. In the tent are also some of the food they have stolen or hunted, mainly meat in a sled. The
      party can just steal the sled or delve into the temple. There are no barbarians around except the three
      \pagelink{monster:barbarian}{barbarian} guards on top. When the party comes back up from the temple they will face
      a barbarian raiding party and are forced to escape into the temple.
      <sub-area-title name="The Entrance Top" />
      A leather tent that conceals a sled full of meat and dairy products and a stone platform that has a heavy iron
      double door that can be locked from inside. Few guards are guarding. When the group returns from the temple they
      notice a raid party of 15 barbarians close by riding towards them. Escaping is hard so they are forced to fight or
      escape into the temple.
      <sub-area-title name="Entry Hall" />
      A stone stairway takes the party into a 60ft wide and 100ft long hall filled with animal hides, straw beds and
      food storage. Another large iron door separates the stairs from this hall but it is open now. It can also be
      locked with a latch. Not that many weapons around because the barbarians are out raiding. No-one is in sight. A
      thorough search of the hall reveals a letter that orders the barbarians to keep on raiding. "Metsäläiset will
      honour the contract". The letter is sealed with the same black eagle as the letters before. The party also finds a
      blue painting of a woman's face behind the layer of grime on the back wall. Seeing the lady brings a sentence into
      the party member's minds: \begin{DndReadAloud} I am an eye set in a blue face. My gaze feeds the world. If I go
      blind so does the world. (Silmä kasvoin sinisten, ravitsija maailmankaiken, näköni jos veisi, veisi näön maan,
      sokeaksi kaiken tekisi.) \end{DndReadAloud} This is a riddle and the correct answer is the sun. Even thinking of
      the correct answer with any language causes a secret door to open and reveal another hall.
      <sub-area-title name="Päivätär Shrine" />
      This hall is slightly smaller than the first one. A grand statue of the sun, although dusty, stands at the back of
      it, and a red carpet leads to it. A ray of light shines through the ceiling at it. It comes from a magical one-way
      window that works also as an escape hatch. A dark figure lays in front of it covered in dust. It is hard to see
      what it is. When the party enters the room the figure starts to move. It is a
      \pagelink{monster:youngGoldDragon}{Young Gold Dragon} that has been hibernating under a spell and commanded to
      guard the temple. It shakes off the dust and reveals the golden scales in all their glory. It queries the party of
      their purpose with a low voice. If the party is meaning good, the dragon can explain that this is Päivätär's
      shrine and he is commanded to guard it until the sun is eaten and all hope is lost. The dragon can be convinced to
      help kill the barbarians or fly the party up to the window. Päivätär is the goddess of day and sun, a beautiful
      lady who "owns the gold of the sun" just like Kuutar, the goddess of the moon, owns "the silver of the moon".
      Unfortunately, there is not much more information of these goddesses in Finnish folk lore. Praying at the shrine
      and gifting the goddess a decent amount of gp will yield a magical item. E.g. giving min. 10gp with a decent
      prayer will give some potion, e.g. Potion of Healing (Greater), min. 50gp yields some magical item e.g. Lantern of
      Revealing. Min. 200gp yields an uncommon weapon and min. 500gp a rare armor. These limits are not set in stone so
      you should consider the PC's sacrifice. One item per PC! Extra prayers give nothing and won't take the money
      either! If the party don't know how to pray maybe the dragon can give them a hint to offer some "gold of the sun"
      to the goddess. \DndItemHeader{Sunstroke (Auringonpistos)}{Sword, uncommon} Some Sword +1. A plain high quality
      sword. \DndItemHeader{Rays of Our Lives (Päivien Viemä)}{Medium Armor, uncommon} Some Armor +1. A plain high
      quality steel armor. \DndItemHeader{Sunmist Blade (Auer)}{Sword, rare} Some Sword +2. A sword with golden
      decoration. \DndItemHeader{Heartgleam (Sydänkajo)}{Medium Armor, rare} Some Armor +2. A steel armor with golden
      trims and golden sun on the chest. \clearpage \begin{figure}[h!] \caption{Shrine of Päivätär}

      The capital of metsäläiset. A village built of stone and ice up north at the bank of northern part of Viper's Rend
      on the side of Winter's Teeth (Talvenhampaat) mountains. The area between the mountains is called Winter's Throat
      (Talvenkurkku). \paragraph{Mistress Loviatar} The queen of metsäläiset, the mistress of north. She is descendant
      of Louhi, the evil witch queen from the beginning of time and the one who created Pohjola demiplane. Loviatar
      shares Louhi's interests and tries to take Pohjola with the help of Perkele. For that, she needs to first find
      four pieces of Tursaansydän (Heart of Tursas), the key to Perkele's prison. She has ordered her people metsäläiset
      to search for ancient places for information. She already holds one piece of Tursaansydän and carries it
      everywhere. This piece was given to Louhi for safekeeping and has been passed on for generations. Loviatar has
      skin of pure white, black long hair and is as beautiful as every Louhi's kin has been (very). She commands her
      people with the help of Joukahainen, her advisor.
      <sub-area-title name="Viper's Rend Toll Station" />
      Another source of income for metsäläiset is the river toll station in the northern part of Viper's Rend. They
      collect tolls from passing ships, usually ones delivering ores from the mountains in the north. Just passing the
      station costs 100gp without any load.
